App component is the starting component so keep it minimal

SOLID
Atomic Design Pattern

Keep components as singular as possible
render() should return something

Bootstrap is a toolkit, gives Bootstrap components
in html its class in Dom its className
Bootstrap grid system

Props are read-only
State is the private to the component instance

React only understand props and states for data
State is created at component level

Mounting phase where calling the render() for the first time
Then comes Updating phase calling render() of the component each time the state of that component changes. This happens for all components

React creates a virtual DOM.
from virtual components to virtual DOM to actual DOM

Optimization techniques are done on virtual DOM

In Updating Phase new virtual DOM is created. Then the difference within the current snapshot of virtual DOM and previous snapshot of virtual DOM is calculated and the only difference is updated in the Actual DOM
Diffing alogrithm in React
Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop. Key acts as an unique identifier in virtual DOM.

Mounting Phase Keys = 1 2 3 4 5
Updating Phase Keys = 1 2 3 4 5
but for component 2 the state is changed(can be deleted or a new component migth be added)
so only the component 2 will be updated in the Actual DOM and the render() will be called 
React will internally manipulate the Actual DOM

Functional Components: Using function to define a component, a lightweigth way of creating components
Hooks gives power to functional component to use of state and other React features within functional components, eliminating the need for class components to manage state and lifecycle methods
there is lesser footprint compared to class based component

In functional component dont need to inherit and dont need to have render method.
so when we return then the render method is called

Functional Component returns some jsx

Types of Hooks: (React version 16.8 onwards)
-> State Hooks (useState method) to attach state to your components
-> Async Hooks (useEffect method)
