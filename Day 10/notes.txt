Reconciliation in React, in diffing algo, or something

Keep the code as modular as possible. As for navbar in the App component you should create a header component and then just instantiate the header component in App component

Routing parameters

React with TS

Node uses JS event-loop

v8 engine fastest js engine, used in chrome

when using setTimeout like webApis, we use Node js apis, which internally uses C,C++ libraries like libuv for kernal level access like file system, os access

but can use fetch api or anything specific to browser/webApis

Node is a executable file which runs our js code
REPL(Read, Evalute, PRint, Loop)

with just node we enter into repl mode

node add.js // here node exe file will execute the add.js file. But here code will not loop unless we do it within add.js
Node is a runtime, used to create web apps(Server side applications), rich set of tools which can be build on top of node.


Module in Node:
built-in
custom
npm

with export default we can have only one default export for a Module(export default add)
but can have multiple name exports (export substract, export multiply)

for every request server do the following:
LOCATE THE file, read the content of the file and send back the stream of the content back to the client
